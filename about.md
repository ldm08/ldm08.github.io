I work in real estate and like doing projects in sports analytics for fun. I code in both Python and R and try my best to #keepitfunctional.

I earned my B.S. in statistics and analytics from UNC Chapel Hill and I am currently an investment researcher working for J.P. Morgan Alternatives in New York City.

Go Lakers.
