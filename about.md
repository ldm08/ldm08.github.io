I use data to build tools and derive insights.

My focuses are in real estate, gis analytics and sports analytics. I code in both Python and R and try my best to #keepitfunctional.

I earned my B.S. in statistics and analytics from UNC Chapel Hill and I am currently a Data Scientist working for J.P. Morgan Real Estate Americas in  New York City. 

Go Lakers.
