I like to combine statistics and software engeering for impactful data analysis and model building.

My current domain areas are private quity real estate and sports analytics. I code in Python, R, and SQL mostly. I try my best to #keep it functional.

I earned my B.S. in statistics and analytics from UNC Chapel Hill and I am currently an investment researcher working for J.P. Morgan Alternatives in  New York City. 

Go Lakers.
